All airlines provide additional or special services for their most loyal frequent flyers, but often the check-in or baggage check process ends up becoming a bottleneck for all passengers. Qantas is transforming the pre-departure process by automating its check-in, baggage drop and boarding process using smart-card RFID technology embedded in its frequent flyer Q Cards and Q Bag Tags, and using smart kiosks and baggage handling technology for all flyers. For frequent flyers, the Q Bag Tag replaces paper baggage tags, and provides insight as bags are traced through the journey, helping reduce the number of lost bags, and helping improve passenger satisfaction. Real-time information and rules-based analysis help provide the right service to each customer. For example, while Qantas collects additional revenue for excess baggage weight, parents travelling with children are automatically given additional weight allowances, as are high value passengers. The overall result is fewer queues, better service, and greater recognition to customers for their continued loyalty.

The ancient city of Ningbo, home to one of the busiest ports in the world, needed to update it antiquated and inefficient logistical systems. Working with IBM, the city is developing the Smart Logistics Center to streamline the port’s entire supply chain and allow the 5,000 logistics companies in Ningbo to share data.
The city of Ningbo has modernised their logistics with IBM Cloud - Now every shipping vehicle has a GPS tracker, the idling of trucks has decreased and the circulation of goods has accelerated. Through this platform, Ningbo is setting a precedent for the rest of China.

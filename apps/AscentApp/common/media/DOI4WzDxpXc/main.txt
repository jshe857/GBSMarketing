They were all dishes designed by IBM Watson’s cognitive cooking system, expanding the scope of cognitive computing systems by exploring if a machine can be creative. Watson has been at work in healthcare, finance, and retailing, helping professionals make more informed decisions - Now we’re on the verge of seeing if a cognitive computing system can make us more creative by coming up with new ideas and solutions. 
The pinnacle of human intelligence is often said to be creativity; the promise of computational creativity is the ability to assist humans in thinking outside the box. Going from making inferences about the world to generating new things the world has never seen before is a next step in cognitive computing. Researchers set out to explore this in the culinary field, collaborating with professional chefs at the Institute of Culinary Education (ICE) in New York, to develop strategies to implement computational creativity in the culinary arts.

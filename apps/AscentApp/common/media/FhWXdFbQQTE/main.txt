Cancer is a genetic disease with two large hurdles in the way of treating it. First, some patients may need to try many different treatments before finding one that works, which wastes valuable time. Second, oncologists can’t keep up with the avalanche of medical data on cancer. But the New York Genome Centre is using IBM Watson for Life Sciences to help overcome those obstacles. Watson’s ability to read millions of pages of medical data in seconds had turned it into a powerful resource for information on cancer. Geneticists hope that running the DNA sequence of a brain cancer tumour through Watson will provide information that could help them quickly develop the best, personalised treatment for that patient.
